# Seven Segment Display Driver Assessment

This repository is where you will develop a driver for the Seven Segment Display peripherals on the DE1-SoC.

Please refer to the assignment specification on Minerva for more details.

The following files are provided:

| File | Purpose |
| ---  | --- |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/.project`      | Skeleton DS-5 project definition |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/.cproject`     | As above |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/main.c`        | A test program which will allow you to test your solution (**do not modify**). |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.h` | The header file which defines the interface for the driver (**do not modify**). |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.c` | The implementation file for the driver. You need to complete this file. |

Please note the project will need configuring in DS-5 before it will compile.
