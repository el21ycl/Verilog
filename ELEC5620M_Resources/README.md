# Resources for ELEC5620

University-provided drivers, scatter files and debug configurations to aid programming the DE1-SoC HPS for ELEC5620M Embedded Systems Design for System-on-Chip at the University of Leeds.

## Drivers

C source files which enable support for various hardware peripherals on the development board.

## Scatter files

Memory scatter files which tell the compiler how to lay out the final binary so that the processor can decode instructions and data properly.

## Debug Config

A special DS-5 eclipse project which assists connecting to the hardware for executuion and step-by-step debugging.
